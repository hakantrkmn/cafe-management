## Key Patterns and Preferences

### Development Approach

- **Type-first development**: Define types before implementation
- **Component-driven**: Build reusable, composable components
- **API-first**: Design APIs before UI implementation
- **Mobile-responsive**: Ensure all interfaces work on tablets
- **Turkish localization**: All user-facing text in Turkish
- **CSS Architecture**: Component classes in globals.css, no hardcoded styles
- **Esthetic Design**: Centered layouts with max-width containers for better UX

### Code Organization

- **Feature-based structure**: Group related functionality
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Consistent naming**: Follow established conventions
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear code documentation
- **shadcn/ui components**: Consistent UI component library
- **Component modularity**: Small, focused, reusable components
- **Type safety**: Strong TypeScript typing throughout
- **Page hooks pattern**: Custom hooks encapsulate page logic and state management
- **Tab component architecture**: Separate components for each tab with independent state management
- **Dialog component separation**: Feature-specific dialog components for better maintainability
- **Order system architecture**: Complete order workflow with drag-and-drop table layout
- **Cart state management**: Local state with localStorage persistence for table positions
- **Transaction handling**: Database transactions for data consistency and integrity

### Authentication Patterns

- **Role-based access**: Manager vs Staff permissions
