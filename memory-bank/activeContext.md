# Active Context: Cafe Management System

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Initial Setup Complete
**Last Updated**: December 2024
**Current Focus**: Foundation and core architecture planning

## Recent Changes

- ✅ Next.js 15 project initialized with TypeScript
- ✅ Tailwind CSS 4 configured
- ✅ ESLint setup with Next.js configuration
- ✅ Basic project structure established
- ✅ Memory bank documentation created
- ✅ MongoDB Prisma schema created with all models
- ✅ Prisma Client generated successfully
- ✅ NextAuth.js authentication system implemented
- ✅ Custom useAuth hook created
- ✅ Sign-in and sign-up pages created
- ✅ Dashboard with role-based access created

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **UI Component Library**: Set up shadcn/ui or similar component system
2. **API Routes**: Create basic CRUD operations for all models
3. **Seed Data**: Create initial data for categories and sample menu items
4. **Cafe Management**: Implement cafe creation and settings for managers
5. **Menu Management**: Create menu categories and items management

### Active Decisions Needed

1. **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui vs custom components
2. **State Management**: Context API vs Zustand
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events

## Key Patterns and Preferences

### Development Approach

- **Type-first development**: Define types before implementation
- **Component-driven**: Build reusable, composable components
- **API-first**: Design APIs before UI implementation
- **Mobile-responsive**: Ensure all interfaces work on tablets

### Code Organization

- **Feature-based structure**: Group related functionality
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Consistent naming**: Follow established conventions
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear code documentation

## Important Learnings

### Technical Insights

- Next.js 15 with App Router provides excellent foundation
- Tailwind CSS 4 offers modern styling capabilities
- TypeScript strict mode ensures type safety
- Turbopack provides fast development experience

### Project Insights

- Cafe management requires real-time updates
- Mobile-first design is crucial for POS systems
- Role-based access control is essential
- Offline capability would be valuable for reliability

## Current Challenges

1. **Technology Stack Decisions**: Need to finalize core technology choices
2. **Database Design**: Complex relationships between orders, inventory, staff
3. **Real-time Requirements**: Balancing performance with live updates
4. **User Experience**: Creating intuitive interfaces for different user types

## Next Session Priorities

1. Set up database and ORM
2. Implement basic authentication
3. Create core data models
4. Build dashboard layout
5. Start with order management interface

## Context for Future Development

- Focus on MVP features first (orders, basic menu, simple inventory)
- Ensure scalability for future features
- Maintain clean architecture for easy maintenance
- Prioritize user experience and performance
